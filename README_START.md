# This project was created for your dapp application.
Instructions for the local development of a smart contract can be found in [contract Readme](./contract/README.md) . A UI folder has also been created in which your frontend project is located. Use the [WharKit](https://wharfkit.com/) library to interact with the [globalforce](https://globalforce.io) network. In the future, we will introduce a wallet plugin for [WharKit](https://wharfkit.com/) so that your users can conveniently use Wallet Connect, which we have developed to connect their wallets to your decentralized applications.
